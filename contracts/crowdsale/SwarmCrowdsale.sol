/**
 * @title SwarmCrowdsale
 * @dev SwarmCrowdsale is a contract for managing a token crowdsale.
 * Crowdsales have a start and end block, where investors can make
 * token purchases and the crowdsale will assign them tokens based
 * on a token per ETH rate. Funds collected are forwarded to a wallet
 * as they arrive.
 * 
 * Time values are in block numbers.
 *
 * Rate is initial value of ETH in USD.  Each token starts out costing approx 1 USD and increases
 * as tokens are sold.  rate = USD price of ETH (e.g. "300")
 *
 * Wallet is the address where all incoming funds will be forwarded.  Should be a multisig for security.
